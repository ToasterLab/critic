##Building

Run `npm update && npm install` to get all the npm dependencies.

The default gulp task (`gulp`) will watch the `src/styles` and `src/scripts` folders for `.sass` and `.coffee` file changes respectively, then automatically compile them and transfer them to the `dist` folder.

##Running

Load it as an unpacked extension in Chrome.
